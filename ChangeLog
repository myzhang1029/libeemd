Notable changes from previous release:

Version 1.5.0:
	* Better modularization of the source code
	* Store version string in the library
	* Make S-number criterion more robust by explicitly checking the
	  signs of minima and maxima. This partially undoes the changes done
	  for 1.3

Version 1.4.1:
	* Fix bug in CEEMDAN SNR fixing introduced in 1.4; in some cases
	  (especially N=16) the noise can have zero variance causing an overflow

Version 1.4:
	* pyeemd splitted to a separate project
	* Easier installation on OSX
	* The GSL error handler is disabled and realistic errors are instead
	  handled by libeemd
	* In CEEMDAN the SNR is fixed separately for each mode as done by Torres
	  et al

Version 1.3.1:
	* Minor documentation improvements
	* Minor bug fix about possible redefinition of NDEBUG

Version 1.3:
	* New default stopping parameters for pyeemd
	* pyeemd warns if using num_siftings=0
	* Completely reworked S-number criterion handling
	* Minor bug fixes
	* Minor improvements to unit tests

Version 1.2:
	* Rudimentary error reporting in the C API
	* Allow setting number of IMFs to compute

Version 1.1:
	* Implementation of CEEMDAN
	* Allow setting the RNG seed
	* Documentation improvements
	* Minor optimizations
